- Continue your coding journey as you dive deeper into the foundational concepts, practices, and terminology of programming. In this installment of the Programming Foundations series, we go beyond the basics, using Python to tackle a variety of intermediate and advanced concepts and skills you can add to your programming repertoire.
- We will cover creating and working with collections and loops, combining and manipulating strings, and using external codeâ€”all of which are critical concepts, regardless of which programming language you end up working with.
- We go over several essential processes, such as choosing a **code style and debugging**. 
- Plus, we dig into a few more advanced concepts, including **memory management and multithreading**.


# 3. External Code

## 3.3 Understanding Libraries and Frameworks

- Getting the difference between libraries and frameworks can be really challenging. Both of them are larger collection of software tools to help devs accomplish specific tasks.
- Library gives you a set of tools that you may use as you wish, a framework has strict set of rules and it defines how you should accomplish a task. When you decide to use a framework, some decisions are already made for you.
- As long as you understand how to code within the framework, it can save us a lot of time. But if you aren't into framework standards and approac for the long haul, or if there is no framework that meets the needs of what you are creating then you cna decide on your own approach to code it up and use one or more libraries as tools to help you get it done.
- Python has popular libraries like **TensorFlow** and **Pandas** for ML tasks exists. **NumPy** and **SciPy** for mathematical manipulations.
- Widely used Python frameworks are **Django** and **Flask** for web development.
- Other languages has libraries such as Lodash and jQuery for JS, as well as JS Frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue.
- When starting out you don't even need libraries, forget about frameworks to write code.
- As you begin to take large scale challenges and tasks in a specific programming languages, see what libraries and frameworks are available at your disposal.

# 5. Planning a Program

## 5.1 Style Guides

- Style Guides: Documentation on approaches to write clean code.
- Online style guides are present for almost all major programming languages. For python there is [PEP-8](https://pep8.org) style guide, Google Python Style guide etc.
- For JS there is a popular style guide by [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- You don't have to memorize style guides, use these as a pointer if you feel like something doesn't feels right or isn't efficient, or if you see code written by other people that takes a different approach. These are merely there to help you write efficient code which is as understandable as possible.

## 5.2 Writing Pseudocode

- This is basically writing details of what you are trying to do in a language which is a mix of plain language, code and comments.
- It helps the developer to create the basic outline of what you are trying to make. Just describe what you need to accomplish, and this is language or framework independent. Given the structure and scope of what you want to build, sometimes Psuedocode can help you in deciding which language to pick for a project as well.
- Writing psuedocode is like knowing about all the edge cases, and accounting for all the main factors. This is the planning that you need to take before writing code.
