"""
Instead of re-inventing the wheel, it's better to just use the wheel. Developers often create code to accomplish basic tasks, and these collection of helpful functions/methods are called libraries. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, we can simply find the existing shared code that does what we need and rather we can focus on custom parts of our application.

Terms for shared code vary from language to language. Most basic type of shared code in Python is called a module. It is a python file that contains code like variables of functions.
Library: This is using multiple modules together so they are distributed and used in a group.
Framework: When a set of code is not just used together but in a specific way, it is distributed as a framework.
Modules, libraries, packages and frameworks can help, when you have a deadline and you want to get work done quickly and efficiently.
