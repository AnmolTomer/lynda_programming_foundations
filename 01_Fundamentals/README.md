- Gain the core knowledge to begin programming in any language. In this course,we use Python to explore the core concepts and structure of programming languages and it helps you grasp what’s going on under the hood. After going over basic statements and expressions in Python,we explore strings, variables, and conditional code—which are common topics in all programming languages. We see how to work with different kinds of data and troubleshoot a variety of errors. Along the way, we compare how code is written in several different languages and provides guidance on the criteria to use when choosing a programming language. Upon wrapping up this course, you’ll have the knowledge you need to continue your coding journey in whichever language piques your interest.
